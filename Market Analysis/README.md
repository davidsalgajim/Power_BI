help a national chain clothing company to create a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and 
they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, 
but they did not know who to target. They need you to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

In this project, it has been used population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists 
around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. 

the company did not know the incomes of their customers, but I should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history 
and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, it was analyzed customer ratings and return rate to see 
if there was a correlation between the two.
