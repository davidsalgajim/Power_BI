Help a national chain clothing company to create a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat, and 
they want to lure lost customers back. They wanted to advertise specific products to specific customers in particular locations 
but did not know who to target. They need you to analyze the best advertising outcome for each customer.

In this project, it has been used population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the most significant income exists 
around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and revenue. 

The company did not know their customers' incomes, but I should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history 
and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, it analyzed customer ratings and return rates to see 
if there was a correlation between the two.
